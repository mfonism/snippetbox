# Snippet Box

A web application for sharing snippets of text &mdash; think Pastebin or GitHub Gists!

Built as I walk through [Alex Edward](https://alexedwards.net/)'s book, [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) with my friends from our small GoLang Study Group (uninspiredly named "There We Go!") at [ROYGBIVery](https://roygbivery.com/).
